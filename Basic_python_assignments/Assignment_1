# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
# 
#     *   :   expression
#     
#     'hello'	:  values
#     
#     -87.8: values
#     
#     - 	: expression
#     
#     / 	: expression
#     
#     +	: expression
#     
#     6	: values
#     
# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
# 
#         Variable: Variable is a store of information
#             E.g.:  a=2 ,a is  variable
#         String: String is a type of information you would store in a Variable
#             E.g.: P=”hi”, “hi” is  string and P is variable stores string i.e. “hi”
#         
# 3. Describe three different data types.
# 
#         Numeric data types: 	int, float, complex number
#         
#         Sequence types: 	list, tuple, strings 
#         
#         Boolean type:	Bool (Boolean)
#         
#         Binary types:	bytes, byte array, memory view        
#         Mapping data type (Dictionary data type):	dict
#         Set data types:	set, frozen set
#         
# 4. What is an expression made up of ?  What do all expressions do ?
# 
#         An expression in Python is a combination of operators and operands   
#             E.g. : y = x + 1 
#         all expressions do  anything that executes and ends up being a value
# 
# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
# 
#           A statement in Python is used for creating variables or for displaying values.
#           The expression in Python produces some value or result after being interpreted by the Python interpreter
# 
# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1

# In[1]:


bacon = 22
bacon + 1


# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 
#         'spam' + 'spamspam'
#         'spam' * 3

# In[2]:


'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3


# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
#    
#        variable names cannot begin with number or cannot be a  number.

# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
# 
#         int() , float() , and str( )
# 

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 
#         'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
#         
#         strings and integers cannot be added . it gives type error
#         type error can be fixed by converting int to  str

# In[3]:


'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'


# In[4]:


'I have eaten ' + "99" + ' burritos.'


# In[ ]:
